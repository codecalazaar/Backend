STATELESS AUTHENTICATION:

//these tokens/session ids are used for the user authentication and is for induvidual user to fetch details of the each user rather than
all users info.

//server doesn't keep any state instead put the data in a token and send it as cookie, which requires less memory usage of server.
//we generate tokens based on the secret code that we have and if the token changed then data is also changed
//the data we fetch remains same even after the server restarts cause the server doesn't have any state related to data
//it will have longer session untill the cookie is deleted that contains the token


jwt : JSON web token

npm i jsonwebtoken

//when the user is logged in with a token then the session is established
//we can loggin into the same user from other device browser untill the initial token session is in use 
//if the session is ended then the token is deleted then we cannot login into that user if we use the same token which is deleted



//for role :
  default: 'NORMAL' is set for every user who is already signed up or the new ones signing up
